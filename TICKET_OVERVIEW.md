Overall review and recommendations
Comprehensiveness – The backlog now covers the entire stack: front‑end UI, authentication flows, subscription management, analytics/monitoring, and the back‑end API with all required endpoints, security, documentation and deployment. There are no obvious missing features given the current scope.

Duplicate/overlapping tickets – YTS‑50 and YTS‑49 both describe API documentation via Swagger
Linear
; they should be merged to avoid duplication.

Phasing and dependencies – Tackle foundational back‑end tasks (YTS‑35, YTS‑36, YTS‑37, YTS‑38, YTS‑39) before advanced features (batch extraction, Stripe). On the front‑end, continue building on Phase 2/3 progress, ensuring all UI components are wired to the API once it’s available.

Testing and quality – YTS‑41, YTS‑26 and YTS‑27 collectively establish a solid testing and CI pipeline; make sure they evolve along with the codebase.

Security and monitoring – YTS‑43 and YTS‑47 contain a comprehensive list of security and monitoring tasks; implement these gradually but do not skip them, as they’re crucial for protecting user data and maintaining uptime.
