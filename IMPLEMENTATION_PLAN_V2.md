# YTScript Implementation Plan v2.0

## Current State Analysis

The project has a partial implementation in `/visual-pages/` with:
- Basic Next.js app structure with Tailwind CSS
- Existing components: `TranscriptExtractor`, `Toast`, `ErrorBoundary`, `MobileMenu`
- Context providers referenced but not implemented: `AuthContext`, `ToastContext`
- Missing critical configuration files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`
- **Backend Dependency**: Requires API at `http://localhost:5000` or mock implementation

## Critical Dependencies & Prerequisites

### API Contract Documentation
Before starting Phase 2, document and confirm these API endpoints:
- **Authentication**: 
  - POST `/api/auth/login`
  - POST `/api/auth/register`
  - POST `/api/auth/forgot-password`
  - POST `/api/auth/reset-password`
  - POST `/api/auth/verify-email/send`
  - GET `/api/auth/verify-email/:token`
- **Core Features**:
  - POST `/api/extract` (single video)
  - POST `/api/extract/batch` (multiple videos)
- **User Management**:
  - GET/PUT `/api/user/profile`

3. **Performance Issues**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading early
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency updates and security audits

### Schedule Risks
1. **Buffer Time**: Added 30% buffer to original estimates
2. **Parallel Work**: Identify tasks that can be done concurrently
3. **MVP Scope**: Define minimum viable features for each phase

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Confirm backend API status** - Is it available or do we need full mocking?

3. **Set up MSW** for API mocking if backend unavailable
4. **Document API contracts** in a separate `API_CONTRACTS.md` file
5. **Create development environment** with all necessary tools
